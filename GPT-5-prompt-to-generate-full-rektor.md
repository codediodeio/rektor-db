# A one-shot Pompt for GPT-5 which will create complete end-to-end no-questions no-bs Rektor DB so that all other DBs go rekkkkkkttttt!

Create a fully managed vector database with the following enhanced features and detailed instructions, including technical sources, frameworks, and a code layout for the project:

Single-stage filtering: Enable searching and filtering by metadata in one query using Pinecone's single-stage filtering capability. Integrate Pinecone's Python SDK for this feature, which streamlines the process and improves efficiency.

Pinecone Python SDK: https://docs.pinecone.io/docs/python-sdk
Expressive query syntax: Implement a GraphQL-like interface for explorative data science querying on rich entity data using Weaviate's expressive query syntax. Integrate Weaviate's Python client for this purpose, allowing users to easily navigate and extract insights from the data.
